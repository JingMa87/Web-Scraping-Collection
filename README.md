This is a web scraping project that I'm working on using Java, Maven and Selenium. 
It's a collection of Java classes that each deal with a problem when scraping websites or files.
The goal of the repo is to swiftly find example code for dealing with common scraping problems.
Since the repo is public, other developers are invited to contribute.

### Contributing

This project has medium-level difficulty and I would like to invite programmers to start engaging in open source here.
If you encounter a new scraping problem, feel free to start an issue in the Issue Tracker and discuss the problem with me.
Creativity is the key to innovation!
